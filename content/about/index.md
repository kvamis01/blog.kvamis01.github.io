## About Me
### Hi there! 👋

Hi, I’m Isak - a Minnesota-based writer interested in climate, decarbonization, and wild places.

This is my blog where I show my work, learn in public, and write for fun. It's intentionally broad. I write about creativity, the outdoors, climate, reading —— things I'm curious bout. Maybe you'll find something interesting, too.

If you'd like to know more about me professionally, head to [my main site](https://www.isakkvam.com/).
