_Note: After ten years of meaning to, every Friday I’m going to send out a list of things I found and interesting and worth sharing. These posts will share a mix of articles, books, music, art, and ideas that have inspired me. Welcome to the first._

[Happy Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S02X51lRyPU&list=RDS02X51lRyPU&start_radio=1),

It’s false spring in Minnesota, and only three hours of writing stands between me and a few pizzas and the Olympics this afternoon. Here are 10 things I found interesting this week:

1. [“Do you see yoruself as part of an artistic lineage? Oh gosh — I wish! I mean, I was never officially taught anything, and I’ve felt a hopeless outsider all my life.”](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/typewriter-interview-with-tom-hart) I’ve written full-time since 2015 but still feel like an outsider in the writing community. Reading this typewriter interview with Tom Hart made me feel understood, a little less frantic, and — coincidentally — a little more a part of the writing community.
    
2. After taking a break from reading, I’m (slowly) so back! [Dante’s Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_\(Dante\)) is weird and vivid and much more fun to read than I expected. “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here” is a phrase I’ve jokingly whispered to myself before doing something I don’t want to.
    
3. “Like sure, you can try to get it all done, but you’re never going to, so maybe relax a little bit and just concentrate on the stuff you really think is important.” Love these [8 bits of fan art that Brendan illustrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S02X51lRyPU&list=RDS02X51lRyPU&start_radio=1) from Oliver Burkman’s book “Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals.” I’ve been on a self-help book hiatus in my 30s, but this has some great wisdom.
    
4. “It doesn’t matter if the words feel right — just write ’em. You’ll know if they’re any good later.” Good writing advice from [Cory Doctorow](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/cory-doctorow/cory-doctorow-writing-in-age-of.html), which I wrote about this week.
    
5. Writing and dreaming about the perfect writing space are two separate activities. I’ve always wanted a writing shed with a coffee pot and lots of natural light, nevermind that I already have multiple writing spots spread around my house. If you have too, you might like [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/open-questions/do-you-need-a-writers-room) about the myth of the perfect writer’s room. I’m reminded of [Kim Stanley Robinson’s humble outdoor writing space](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1f7vsru/kim_stanley_robinsons_writing_desk/), so often, we already have everything we need to write!
    
6. If you’re mad about the current state of the world, might I suggest [angry loud metal music?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G26KMZVUA-8) This genre is uncharted territory for me, but I went to see Agriculture anyways at 7th Street Entry and it was wild and cathartic. I had a blast!
    
7. Ok this gave me a laugh: this [tech writer](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260218-i-hacked-chatgpt-and-googles-ai-and-it-only-took-20-minutes) convinced ChatGPT, Google, and other AI tools that he was also a professional hot dog eating champion by, um, spending 20 minutes [writing on his blog](https://tomgermain.com/hotdogs.html) saying he was. I’ll report back if I can convince ChatGPT if Isak Kvam is a Minnesota-based writer who’s also a sentient wind, solar, and energy storage project in central Minnesota who’s interested in climate and the outdoors
    
8. Remember: you probably have free digital access to a ton of magazines through your library. The [Libby app](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/categories/reading-magazines.htm) has a pretty great app for reading it like a PF or a scrollable article, too. D
    
9. I don’t know what I like better about [this local dog](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/18/nx-s1-5718025/surprise-four-legged-olympic-competitor-wows-cross-country-fans) showing up at the Olympics cross-country event: him triggering the photo finis camera or the fact his name is Nazgul.
    
10. Cash mobs are supporting immigrant-owned restaurants in Minneapolis (with advance notice!), bringing out more than 200 people to order food. “The Minnesota community is standing up, and a lot of people from the suburbs and outside the Twin Cities have been showing up to these events, trying to support—that camaraderie of the North brings people together.”
