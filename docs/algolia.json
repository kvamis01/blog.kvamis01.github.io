[{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Cory Doctorow is one of those writers who\u0026amp;rsquo;s able to write so much so quickly, I\u0026amp;rsquo;m left scratching my head.\nI\u0026amp;rsquo;ve only read one of his 30 or so fiction and non-fiction books — The Lost Cause — and while that\u0026amp;rsquo;s already a prolific catalog, the guy also writes not one but two blogs. Pluralistic, his daily link blog, intimidates me: how does this guy have so much to say every day? And how can he balance this with writing books, finding interesting articles on the internet, and maintain a life with chores, eating, and sleeping?\nSo I did what anybody would do: I read a bunch of essays and interviews with him while watching figure skating on the Olympics.\nLike a lot of writers, he has some straightforward advice:\n\u0026amp;ldquo;I have a daily writing target. It\u0026amp;rsquo;s been as little as one page/day (250 words) and as much as eight pages/day (2,000 words), and I hit it every single day, no matter where I am.

I was killing time hanging out by the river and, having watched most of his brother Casey’s daily vlogs (rip daily vlogs), quickly watched all his videos beginning to end.\nHe can get ranty. He can be cranky. He has plenty of opinions I don’t agree with. But his videos about the creative process are fascinating.\nHis latest, about the struggles of perfectionism as a creative person and working toward “good enough” or “excellent,” is so relatable:\nI usually operate in the “good enough” camp (ESPECIALLY blogging) with regular forays into attempting excellence (usually for work).\nIn the video, Van quotes Vince Lombardi: “Perfectionism is not attainable, but if we chase perfection, we can achieve excellence.”\nI usually ship projects at “good enough” not because I don’t have attention to detail, or get bored, or can’t be …","date":170856e4,"dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":170856e4,"objectID":"cd23ffb344ef7fcfd71d84600847a392","permalink":"https://blog.isakkvam.com/post/perfectionism-is-an-act-of-cowardice/","publishdate":"2024-02-22T00:00:00Z","readingtime":5,"relpermalink":"/post/perfectionism-is-an-act-of-cowardice/","section":"post","tags":["creativity","writing","perfectionism","vanneistat","austinkleon","iraglass"],"title":"Perfection is an act of cowardice","type":"post","url":"/post/perfectionism-is-an-act-of-cowardice/","weight":0,"wordcount":1049},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"dir":"search/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"https://blog.isakkvam.com/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/search/placeholder/","section":"search","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"About Me Hi there! 👋 Hi, I’m Isak - a Minnesota-based writer interested in climate, decarbonization, and wild places.\nThis is my blog where I show my work, learn in public, and write for fun.
