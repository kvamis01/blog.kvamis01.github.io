I was killing time hanging out by the river and, having watched most of his brother Casey’s daily vlogs (rip daily vlogs), quickly watched all his videos beginning to end.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="hi-there-">Hi there! 👋&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Hi, I’m Isak - a Minnesota-based writer interested in climate, decarbonization, and wild places.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my blog where I show my work, learn in public, and write for fun. It&amp;rsquo;s intentionally broad. I write about creativity, the outdoors, climate, reading —— things I&amp;rsquo;m curious bout. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find something interesting, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to know more about me professionally, head to &lt;a href="https://www.isakkvam.com/">my main site&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Posts Archive</title><link>https://blog.isakkvam.com/archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isakkvam.com/archive/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
