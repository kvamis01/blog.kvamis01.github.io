&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read one of his 30 or so fiction and non-fiction books — &lt;em>The Lost Cause&lt;/em> — and while that&amp;rsquo;s already a prolific catalog, the guy also writes not one but two blogs. &lt;em>Pluralistic&lt;/em>, his daily link blog, intimidates me: how does this guy have &lt;em>so much&lt;/em> to say every day? And how can he balance this with writing books, finding interesting articles on the internet, and maintain a life with chores, eating, and sleeping?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I did what anybody would do: I read a bunch of essays and interviews with him while watching figure skating on the Olympics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perfection is an act of cowardice</title><link>https://blog.isakkvam.com/post/perfectionism-is-an-act-of-cowardice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isakkvam.com/post/perfectionism-is-an-act-of-cowardice/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been following Van Neistat’s videos since his fifth video was published, which the YouTube algorithm suggested while I was vanning through Walla Walla, Washington. I was killing time hanging out by the river and, having watched most of his brother Casey’s daily vlogs (rip daily vlogs), quickly watched all his videos beginning to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He can get ranty. He can be cranky. He has plenty of opinions I don’t agree with. But his videos about the creative process are fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His latest, about the struggles of perfectionism as a creative person and working toward “good enough” or “excellent,” is so relatable:&lt;/p>

 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>I usually operate in the “good enough” camp (ESPECIALLY blogging) with regular forays into attempting excellence (usually for work).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.isakkvam.com/search/placeholder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isakkvam.com/search/placeholder/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://blog.isakkvam.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.isakkvam.com/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-me">About Me&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Hi, I’m Isak - a Minnesota-based writer interested in climate, decarbonization, and wild places.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my blog where I show my work, learn in public, and write for fun. It&amp;rsquo;s intentionally broad. I write about creativity, the outdoors, climate, reading —— things I&amp;rsquo;m curious bout. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find something interesting, too.&lt;/p>
