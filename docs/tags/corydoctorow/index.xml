&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only read one of his 30 or so fiction and non-fiction books — &lt;em>The Lost Cause&lt;/em> — and while that&amp;rsquo;s already a prolific catalog, the guy also writes not one but two blogs. &lt;em>Pluralistic&lt;/em>, his daily link blog, intimidates me: how does this guy have &lt;em>so much&lt;/em> to say every day? And how can he balance this with writing books, finding interesting articles on the internet, and maintain a life with chores, eating, and sleeping?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I did what anybody would do: I read a bunch of essays and interviews with him while watching figure skating on the Olympics.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
