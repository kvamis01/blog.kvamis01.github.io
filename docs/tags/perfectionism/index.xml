I was killing time hanging out by the river and, having watched most of his brother Casey’s daily vlogs (rip daily vlogs), quickly watched all his videos beginning to end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He can get ranty. He can be cranky. He has plenty of opinions I don’t agree with. But his videos about the creative process are fascinating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His latest, about the struggles of perfectionism as a creative person and working toward “good enough” or “excellent,” is so relatable:&lt;/p>

 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>I usually operate in the “good enough” camp (ESPECIALLY blogging) with regular forays into attempting excellence (usually for work).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
