[{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"About Me Hi there! 👋 Hi, I’m Isak - a Minnesota-based writer interested in climate, decarbonization, and wild places.\nThis is my blog where I show my work, learn in public, and write for fun.

Maybe you\u0026amp;rsquo;ll find something interesting, too.\nIf you\u0026amp;rsquo;d like to know more about me professionally, head to my main site.\n","date":-62135596800,"dir":"about/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page","url":"/about/","weight":0,"wordcount":71},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"dir":"search/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/search/placeholder/","section":"search","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"dir":"archive/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":"Archive of historical posts.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a06e5ce9eca4c3260843078104889780","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/archive/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/archive/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts Archive","type":"archive","url":"/archive/","weight":0,"wordcount":0}]
